### MoonDRM

MoonDRM was a project I did around summer 2016 as an alternative to [ScriptEnforcer](http://scriptenforcer.net)

You can read why it was discontinued [here](https://scriptfodder.com/community/threads/2074-drm-an-why-i-think-it-sucks/post-16163#post-16163)

**NOTE: PLEASE DO NOT USE MOONDRM. ONLY USE IT AS GUIDANCE FOR CREATING YOUR OWN DRM.**
